# NAsciidoc Project

This project intends to implement a C# native [Asciidoc](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/asciidoc.asciidoc-lang) parser+renderer.

It is not as advanced as Ruby [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org) project but it avoids any layer between the rendering code and actual execution (using ruby/Javascript engine which are generally slow and hard to debug options).

NAsciidoc project is easy to embed in any Asp.Net or plain console application.

Go on the [documentation](docs/getting-started.md) to learn more about the project.
